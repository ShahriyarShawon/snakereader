# SnakeReader
A self hosted comic book written in python/flask

## Progress
Currently only supports having directories of images

## Installation
clone this repo

put your comics in `static/comics`
chapters should be stored in a directory with the comic name

ex
`static/comics/akame_ga_kill/Chapters_{1-20}`

run `./run` for debugging.

This is as far as I got in my first night.
